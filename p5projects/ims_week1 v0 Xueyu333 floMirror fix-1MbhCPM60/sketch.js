      //Spatial noise:
      // noise(x / ns, y / ns) creates noise values based on the particle's position
      // ns (noise scaling factor) equals 60 to make the noise change more gradually
      // Particles in the same area will get similar noise values

      // Time noise:
      // noise(frameCount / nss) creates time-varying noise based on the current frame count
      // nss is equal to 150, which controls the speed of time changes
      // This value will change slowly as the animation progresses

      //Why the order of x and y is swapped？
      // Use noise(x / ns, y / ns) in nx
      // Use noise(y / ns, x / ns) in ny
      // This is done to make the noise in the x and y directions not completely correlated, creating a more natural movement

      bg.ellipse(x - walk + orbitX * nx, y - walk + orbitY * ny, sz, sz);

      // 01：Base position adjustment:
      // (x - walk) and (y - walk) are the adjusted base positions
      // Walk is subtracted to leave space at the edges to prevent particles from moving out of view

      // 02:Orbital motion + noise:
      // orbitX * nx multiplies the x component of the circular orbit by the noise multiplier
      // orbitY * ny multiplies the y component of the circular orbit by the noise multiplier
      // This way, each particle's orbit is no longer a perfect circle, but a slightly deformed path

      //03Final position:
      // x coordinate = (x - walk) + (orbitX * nx)
      // y coordinate = (y - walk) + (orbitY * ny)

      // Without noise (nx and ny are both equal to 1), particles move along perfectly circular orbits. But with noise, each particle's trajectory has a unique deformation, and this deformation changes smoothly over time, creating an organic, flowing visual effect.
      //nx and ny control the "irregularity" of each particle's orbital motion

//I found this interesting camera effect on OpenProcessing—it creates a 3D-like visual experience simply by using particles and fade effects. It's very amazing!
